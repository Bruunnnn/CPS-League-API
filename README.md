# CPS-League-API

## Change "your_api_key_here" to the current API key in the .env file
### If you don't, it will display "summoner not found" as the application cannot search
## When changing the API, you probably need to run the following 3 commands: 
### php artisan config:clear
### php artisan cache:clear
### php artisan config:cache
